Here I have maintained some simple examples to playaround with LangChain modules and working with LLM

1. Pre-requisite: Generate an API key using link https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

2. Clone and Install depenedencies `pip install requirements.txt`

3. Maintain this key in a NEW file `/src/constants.py`
   > openai_key="<your_OpenAI_key>"
   
4. Run individual examples:
`Use command "streamlit run .\<file_path>" to run different examples`

# Features
1. Translate and Learn texts in Dutch
2. Use Sequential Chain to know some interesting facts about your favorite celebrity
3. Generate prompts based on a CSV file data (example: sales order data)
