# Testing OpenAI modules with LangChain

Here I have maintained some simple examples to playaround with LangChain modules and working with LLM

1. Pre-requisite: Generate an API key using link https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

2. Clone and Install depenedencies `pip install requirements.txt`

3. Maintain this key in NEW file => /src/constants.py > openai_key='<your OpenAI key>'

4. Run individual examples:
`Use command "streamlit run .\<file_path>" to run different examples`
